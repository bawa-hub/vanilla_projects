                        A closure is the combination of a function and the lexical environment within which that function was declared. The word "lexical" refers to the fact that lexical scoping uses the location where a variable is declared within the source code to determine where that variable is available. Closures are functions that have access to the outer (enclosing) function's variablesâ€”scope chain even after the outer function has returned.

                    Explain event delegation

                        Event delegation is a technique involving adding event listeners to a parent element instead of adding them to the descendant elements. The listener will fire whenever the event is triggered on the descendant elements due to event bubbling up the DOM. The benefits of this technique are:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Memory footprint goes down because only one single handler is needed on the parent element, rather than having to attach event handlers on each descendant.</li>
                            <li>There is no need to unbind the handler from elements that are removed and to bind the event for new elements.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>

                <div class="accordion-item-header">What's the difference between <span>.call</span> and <span>.apply</span>?</div>
                <div class="accordion-item-body">
                    <div class="accordion-item-body-content">Both <span>.call</span> and <span>.apply</span> are used to invoke functions and the first parameter will be used as the value of <span>this</span> within the function. However, <span>.call</span> takes in comma-separated arguments as the next arguments while <span>.apply</span> takes in an array of arguments as the next argument. An easy way to remember this is C for <span>call</span> and comma-separated and A for <span>apply</span> and an array of arguments.</div>
